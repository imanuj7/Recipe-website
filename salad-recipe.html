    <p>Start your cucumber zucchini salad by washing your produce and then slicing your cucumber and zucchini into thin slices. I find there are two easy ways to do this, one is using a mandolin.</p>
    <p>Or you can also use a vegetable peeler to get the same effect.</p>
    <p>Once your zucchini and cucumber are all sliced, add them to a large bowl.</p>
    <p>Then add the arugula on top.</p>
    <p>And add the halved cherry tomatoes next.</p>
    <p>Then to start your dressing, add the fresh lemon juice. You could also mix the vinaigrette in a separate bowl, but I like to make it right on top of the salad.</p>
    <p>After the lemon juice, drizzle in the olive oil.</p>
    <p>Followed by a bit of Dijon.</p>
    <p>Add the minced basil and season with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
    <p>Toss it all together until everything is evenly coated in the dressing.</p>
