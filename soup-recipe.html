    <p>Start your soup by bringing the chicken broth to a boil; remove about 1 cup of hot broth and set aside. Add the orzo, and season with salt and pepper. Let it simmer for 15 minutes until pasta is tender.</p>
    <p>While pasta simmers, start your cornstarch slurry. Add the cornstarch slowly to the hot broth you have set aside, and whisk until fully incorporated.</p>
    <p>Next, slowly whisk in the lemon juice to the slurry.</p>
    <p>Finish the slurry by slowly whisking in the egg to the hot broth mixture, allowing the eggs to slowly raise in temperature so they don’t scramble or curdle.</p>
    <p>Slowly add your egg/broth mixture back into the large pot with the orzo, and stir until soup thickens.</p>
    <p>Add the shredded or cubed chicken to the pot. To make this dish even easier, I’ll use leftover rotisserie chicken!</p>
    <p>Stir together until chicken is warmed through, and season with additional salt and pepper as needed.</p>
    <p>Serve warm and garnish with green onion or parsley, and enjoy your Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup!</p>
